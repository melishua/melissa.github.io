Hello there! nice to meet you and welcome to my page. I am a software engineer, a master student at Carnegie Mellon University, and a curious human being.

I am interested in machine learning systems, distributed systems, and hyper-scale computing. 

I love to understand how our universe works and I believe that we are in the middle of developing such tool that would help us better understand the truth of this universe.
